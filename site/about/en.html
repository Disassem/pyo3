<p>
I has worked in in software development sphere for over 7 years, and for about 5 years Python has been my primary development tool. During my previous work at medical insurance company Asko-Zabota (medical department of insurance group <a href="http://ugsk.ru" rel="nofollow">Yugoria</a> now) I focused mainly on internal projects related to web, GUI, binary data and network applications. I have developed a couple of open source applications, they are available at <a href="http://github.com/j2a" rel="nofollow">github</a> and <a href="http://bitbucket.org/j2a">bitbucket</a>. In 2009 I joined <a href="http://equelli.com">Equelli</a> as a Senior Python Developer where I started to work on development of online browser strategy game and other projects, along with requirement analysis, consulting and delivering seminars.</p>

<p>I organized the first <a href="http://rupy.ru">RuPyRu</a> conference in 2007 (now it's named <a href="http://margincon.ru">MarginCon</a>)
that became one of the most important yearly events for Ruby and Python developers in Russia. I also has contributed to Byteflow â€“ a Python/Django Blog Engine, and developed this blog about Python, mostly in Russian.
